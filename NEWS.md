* geom text,label, withe repel variants and position dodge for median and mean labels
* added transparency control for densities and histograms as well as linetype mappping
* added binwidth control for histogram (user defined or auto), and position dodge

# ggquickeda 0.1.2
* bug fixed where in some cases plotdata did not apply filtering
* updated and expanded merge multiple levels of a factor
* added mappings by shape for points and linetypes of lines and associated custom legends and possibility to ignore it
* added the possibility of choosing more linetypes for lines
* various UI improvements for points, lines, qr, smooth, median and mean
* added options to control size and transparency of qr, smooth, median and mean lines and added predefined qr 25 and 75%
* added options to force mean and median shapes
* fixed bug in median line not honoring transparency when Median\PI selected with some UI tweaks
* added more options for boxplot outliers (size and transparency)
* separate color control for major and minor gridlines with the possibility to remove them
* added annotation_logticks
* make faceting less prone to fail when user mistakenly choose the same variable in rows and columns
* make user defined color/fill scales

# ggquickeda 0.1.1

* added possibility to keep last row by id
* added more options to label x and y axes ticks e.g. using `prettyNum()`
* added styling options for horizontal and vertical reference lines
* added more methods for the correlation coefficient
* added p-values for slope(s) and adjusted Rsquare when a linear regression smoother is selected
* fixed a bug where x and or y axis zoom would not work in some situations
* added more stats from table1 as well as possibility to cut by quantiles `eqcut()`
* added possibility to merge multiple levels of a factor
* fixed bug where commas in label names broke up the factor levels when using "Recode/Reorder Categories"
